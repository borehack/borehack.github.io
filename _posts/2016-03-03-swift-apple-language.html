head a great introduction into Apple Language Swift today<br /><br />have to say there are a few real strange concepts.<br /><br /><ol><li>checked exceptions? though that concept was dead already. not to mention do try catch syntax</li><li>naming the parameters maybe a good idea. but where is the difference in store the parameter value in a variable and pass this name? The concept of defining a outside variable is confusing. How should I know how the outside calls me?</li><li>to split a string by a character you need a proficiency and to create random numbers you have to copy &amp; paste it from the internet</li></ol>&nbsp;and that's just the impression from one day. want to see a real live example.
